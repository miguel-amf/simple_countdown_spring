Simple Project using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf to create a webpage with a 30 minutes countdown
and play a chiming sound at the end, repeating indefinitely.

Most websites I've encountered that would do a similar task were too convoluted
and sometimes unreliable. This is a very simple idea to help track time for 
stretches, water intake, breaks, check if building is on fire, etc., without 
having to use ad-ridden websites/phone apps.
